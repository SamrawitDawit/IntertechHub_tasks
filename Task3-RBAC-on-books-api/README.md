# ðŸ“š Books Collection API

The **Books Collection API** is a RESTful API built with Flask for managing a personal collection of books. Users can perform CRUD operations on books, validate book data, store and retrieve takeaways for books, and more.

## Features

- Manage books (Add, Read, Update, Delete).
- Validate book data fields such as title, author, ISBN, and published year.
- Store and fetch takeaways (key lessons or notes) for each book.
- MongoDB integration for persistent storage.
- Hosted online for public access.

## Authentication & Authorization
* JWT-based authentication is used.
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
* Admins have full access (e.g., delete books, view all books).
* Users can perform CRUD operations except for admin-specific actions.
